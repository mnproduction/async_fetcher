			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Set up FastAPI Application Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup into: (1) Create project root and directory structure, (2) Scaffold main.py with FastAPI initialization and CORS, (3) Add placeholder files for models, logic, toolkit, and logger, (4) Create requirements.txt and verify app startup.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a modern FastAPI project structure is moderately complex, requiring knowledge of best practices for modularity and maintainability[1][2][3]. The task is foundational but follows established patterns, so 4 subtasks are sufficient to ensure clarity and correctness."

		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Pydantic Data Models",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Define FetchOptions and FetchRequest models with validation, (2) Define response models (JobStatusResponse, FetchResult, FetchResponse), (3) Write unit tests for model validation and edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "Defining robust Pydantic models with validation is essential for API correctness and security. The task is standard for FastAPI but requires careful attention to constraints and test coverage, warranting 3 focused subtasks."

			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Structured Logging with structlog",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Implement logger.py with structlog configuration, (2) Integrate logger into main.py and add request context, (3) Test logging output and context propagation.",
			"reasoning": "Structured logging is critical for observability and debugging. While structlog setup is well-documented, integrating context and ensuring JSON output adds moderate complexity, best handled in 3 steps."

		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Implement StealthBrowserToolkit Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement StealthBrowserToolkit class with browser lifecycle management, (2) Add context and proxy support, (3) Implement fetch_url with error handling, (4) Write unit and integration tests (mocking browser API).",

			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: (1) Implement job creation and storage logic, (2) Implement job status retrieval and result updating, (3) Write unit tests for job store operations and edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "An in-memory job store is straightforward but must be robust and thread-safe for concurrent access. Testing is essential to ensure correctness, so 3 subtasks are appropriate."

			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Implement endpoint handler with request validation, (2) Integrate job creation and background task scheduling, (3) Write integration tests for endpoint behavior and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a POST endpoint with background task initiation is standard in FastAPI, but must be robust and well-tested. Three subtasks ensure clarity and coverage."
